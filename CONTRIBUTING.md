# Contributing to BrainChainPSIT

Thanks for helping improve this project — contributions are welcome!

Quick start for contributors

1. Fork the repository (or be added as a collaborator).
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description
   ```

Branching and PRs

- Use clear branch names: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`.
- Open a PR against `main` and link any relevant issues.
- Use the PR template; include a short description, testing notes and any screenshots.

Code style & tests

- Run tests before opening a PR:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --watchAll=false
  ```
- Keep changes focused and small. If your change is large, open a draft PR early for feedback.

Review & approvals

- Two approving reviews required for production changes (configurable via branch protection).
- Address review comments in follow-up commits; keep PRs rebased/merged cleanly.

When in doubt

- If you're unsure how to implement something, open an issue or a draft PR describing the problem and proposed approach.

Thank you for contributing! Update this document with any team-specific policies.
